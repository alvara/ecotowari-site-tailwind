            Surveys have shown that most flyers are thrown away without being
            read. Apart from the annoyance of finding a lot of unsolicited
            flyers mixed with important mail, how are flyers bad for the
            environment? Below you can see the impact of paper manufacturing.

            As no official data is available on flyers, please note that the
            above only covers the paper manufacturing side of the operations.
            Printing requires further electricity and chemicals. Also, if thrown
            in the general bin as burnable trash, flyers will not be recycled.
            Recycling or burning also requires additional energy.

            We didn&apos;t invent the ‚Äú„ÉÅ„É©„Ç∑„ÅäÊñ≠„Çä‚Äù (chirashi okotowari ‚Äì no to
            flyers) stickers. They have indeed been around for a while and one
            can already see them on mailboxes here and there. However, we were
            unhappy with their design as no mention is made of the environment
            or waste reduction. They include very strong language such as
            &quot;you&apos;re being watched&quot; or &quot;we will report you to
            the police&quot;. We feel this type of wording is a barrier to a
            wider adoption and discourages people from putting them on their
            mailboxes.

            Our goal with ecotowari is to use a different kind of symbolism and

            the planet - instead of the anti-anythingthatcomesnearmydoor
            approach.
