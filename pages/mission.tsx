            While papermaking and printing companies have made efforts over the
            years, paper manufacturing still requires large quantities of water,
            wood, energy and chemical products. For more details about the

            ecotowari is an initiative to tackle the waste generated by flyers
            through a mailbox sticker. The sticker indicates in positive, clear
            terms that you do not wish to receive flyers because you care about
            our planet. Simple as that.

            Founder R√©my Millot recalls: ‚ÄúEver since I settled into my new home
            in Tokyo, I found the number of flyers pouring into my mailbox quite
            overwhelming. As a quick fix that somehow became permanent (as all
            quick fixes tend to be?) I put together some paper tape and a note
            saying I didn‚Äôt want to receive flyers. And much to my surprise,
            that very homemade-looking sticker proved to be working.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="p">
            My other housemates would also complain about receiving too many
            flyers. They liked the idea of a sticker but didn‚Äôt want it to be
            some homemade paper tape. That‚Äôs when I realized we needed a
            ‚Äúproper‚Äù sticker if we wanted this type of initiative to pick up and
            grow.ecotowari was born!‚Äù

            The name ecotowari is a new word bringing together the words eco and
            kotowari, Japanese word for ‚Äúrefusing‚Äù. ecotowari means turning down
            single-use items for environmental reasons.

            We didn&apos;t invent the ‚Äú„ÉÅ„É©„Ç∑„ÅäÊñ≠„Çä‚Äù (chirashi okotowari ‚Äì no to
            flyers) stickers. They have indeed been around for a while and one
            can already see them on mailboxes here and there. However, we were
            unhappy with their design as no mention is made of the environment
            or waste reduction. They include very strong language such as
            &quot;you&apos;re being watched&quot; or &quot;we will report you to
            the police&quot;. We feel this type of wording is a barrier to a
            wider adoption and discourages people from putting them on their
            mailboxes.

            Our goal with ecotowari is to use a different kind of symbolism and

            approach.
